# homelab

This repo contains the configuration and apps I use for learning and experimenting with containers and Kubernetes. 
After being a software developer for a few years, my interests grew towards DevOps, containers, and cloud technologies. 
This homelab is where I learn container orchestration and DevOps principles with example applications.

My homelab is constantly being updated and changed as I learn more complex systems. Most of the ongoing work is found in
the `dev` branch. As apps and systems are completed I merge into the `main` branch and tag it.

### Infrastructure
I am using a few Linux computers for hosting services and a k8s cluster. I am currently using k3s for my clusters.

### Apps
The applications in my homelab are for learning and experience with running custom containers in k8s.

More information can be found for applications and services in each of the directories.
